    Collection details:
    tsds_type: TSDS measurement type we will send the results from simp-comp as
    interval: Polling interval - how frequently we will ask for data from simp-comp
    composite-name: Composite name from simp-comp we are interested in
    filter_name [optional]: If filtering results from SIMP, what field to filter on eg "node"
    filter_value [optional]: If filtering results from SIMP, the value of the field to filter eg ".*chic.*".
                             This is passed in as a string representing a regular expression.

    workers: How many Workers to create

    Host list: List of hosts to collect on
    (Hosts will be divided up among the number of configured workers)

    Exclude list (optional): list of patterns to ask simp-comp to exclude from the results it sends us:
        var: name of a scan variable in which to search results for the pattern
        pattern: a regular expression: if a scan-result matches the regexp, exclude the corresponding
           result from simp-comp's output
